# **CloudDude**

`CloudDude is a web game where users can create and share levels with obstacles and platforms with the goal of getting from point A and point B.`

The game consists of several key features:

- _Level_: This consists of a collection of obstacles and platforms that the user must navigate through to reach a goal. The level design consists of choosing the locations of various objects. The canvas on which a level is edited and designed is a grid. A level specifically is defined by attributes such as, but not limited to, name, obstacle locations, start location, end location, platform locations, and coin locations. These levels are created and imaged by YOU, the user! Furthermore, you as the architect of this level can select how fun you think the level is in addition to giving it a name plus other attributes!
- _Repository of Levels_: This is a collection of levels that are created by other users. In other words, you can not only create new levels of the platformer, but also share what you have created with the community at large FOR FREE INSTANTLY! You will be able to filter through the levels by their difficulty, a funness score, and also by their name.
- _User Profile_: To utilize CloudDude is to have fun. Therefore, you can simply log in via your Google Account and start to create or play different levels of the platformer. You can also check out how many levels you have created thus far in our system in addition to how many you have won! Feel free to customize your name as well!
